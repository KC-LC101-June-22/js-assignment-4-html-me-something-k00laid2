               <h2>The Basics of a Single Switch</h2>
               <p>The so called "water analogy" is very fitting for beginner work on electricity. The water (electricity) flows through the black wire, and then it will flow to our lightbulb, providing the lightbulb with electricity. The 'Single Switch' is simply breaking the black wire, and putting it back together.</p>

               <h2>The Basics of a Three Way Switch</h2>
               <p>The water analogy still functions just fine, but three ways are a little bit harder to wrap your head around. The basics are still the same. Our electricity is flowing from our black wire to the lightbulb. However instead of a single switch breaking and then reconnecting the black wire, we now have two switches, and either one of those two switches is capable of breaking the black wire, and then reconnecting it. There are only two terms that you need to become familiar with. The "Feed" and then the "Travelers". These are industry terms and they will help to grasp this logic function that we call a three way switch. The 'Feed' will simply feed the electricity to our lightbulb. We will feed the electricity into one of our switches, and then the second switch will feed the electricity out of the switch to the lightbulb. The 'Travelers' will not be attached to the lightbulb or attached to our source of electricity. The travelers will only be connecting the two switches to eachother. So, we input the feed into the first switch, then we attach 2 travelers between the switches, and then we output the feed to our lightbulb. The switches will be labelled where to attach the feeds and the travelers.</p>

               <h2>The Basics of a Four Way Switch</h2>
               <p>The four way switch can still be visualized with the water anaology. But it might be easier to understand simply by using the industry standard terminology. For a four way switch, we still only have 2 pieces to work with: feeds and travelers. The same concept applies, we will be feeding the electricity into the first switch, and we will be outputting the electricity from our last switch in the series. The only difference is: between the switches that do not contain the feeds, you are going to use 'input travelers' and 'output travelers'. A common way to keep track of these is to twist your input travelers a few times, and your output travelers a few times. This will keep you from getting them mixed up. The fourway switch will be labeled with the input and output connection points. The amazing thing about the 'Four Way Switch' is that you can connect as many four way switches in series as you'd like. You only need to continue chaining input travelers and output travelers between your fourway switches. This is essential for long hallways with many rooms attached to them. You will want to be able to switch the hallway lights from whichever room you are entering or exiting. </p>

               <h2>The Basics of the Panel</h2>
               <p>When it comes to understanding the basics of the electrical panel, the water analogy is perfect for beginners. The water will flow in from our black and/or red wires (marked B). The water will flow through our connection points (marked A), and down to all of our breakers. The water will flow through our breakers into our black wires and then out of the panel. The black wires will carry the water up towards our light bulbs and other devices. After the water flows through our lightbulbs and other devices, the water will return to our panel through the white wires. That is called a complete circuit. </p>
